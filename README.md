Hello! 

This is now my 3rd Directory that I created while working through the Odin Project Foundations. 

I used to be shit scared of terminals, had no clue how they work, with the help of this course I have managed to create these 3 projects all with the terminal. I am looking forward in learning more commands and utilize the terminal more in my day to day. 

Moving on....

This is a recipes project, and I have some great recipes in store.

Let's get cooking!
